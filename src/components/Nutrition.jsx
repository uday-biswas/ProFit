      <div className="w-4/6 text-center m-auto">Creating a balanced nutrition plan is crucial to achieving your fitness goals. Here's a detailed guide on meal planning, timing, meal prepping tips, and sample meal plans tailored for different fitness goals.</div>

      <div className="border-1 rounded-lg bg-slate-700 w-5/6 p-3 m-auto my-4">
      <h3 className="text-xl text-center mb-3">Meal Planning and Timing</h3>
         
          <strong>Pre-Workout Meals:</strong> These meals should provide a source of easily digestible carbohydrates to fuel your workout. Examples include oatmeal, a banana, or a slice of whole-grain toast.
          <br/><strong>Post-Workout Meals:</strong> After exercise, your body needs protein and carbohydrates for recovery. Opt for sources like lean chicken, sweet potatoes, and vegetables.
          <br/><strong>Daily Nutrition:</strong> Plan well-rounded meals that include a balance of macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, fats) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). Focus on whole, unprocessed foods for your daily intake.
          <br/><strong>Portion Sizes:</strong> Pay attention to portion sizes to avoid overeating. Use measuring cups or your hand as a guide for portion control.
          <br/><strong>Meal Frequency:</strong> Some people prefer three large meals, while others opt for smaller, more frequent meals. Choose the meal frequency that suits your lifestyle and appetite.

      <h3 className="text-xl text-center mb-3">Meal Prepping Tips</h3>         
          <strong>Batch Cooking:</strong> Prepare meals in advance and store them in individual containers. This approach simplifies meal choices and saves time during the week.
          <br/><strong>Storage Suggestions:</strong> Invest in quality food storage containers to keep meals fresh. Glass or BPA-free plastic containers are excellent choices.          
          <br/><strong>Label and Date:</strong> Label each container with the meal's name and date of preparation to ensure you're consuming fresh food.      
          <br/><strong>Freezer-Friendly:</strong> Many dishes freeze well, so consider batch-cooking and freezing extra portions for convenience.
